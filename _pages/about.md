I am a theoretical physicist, interested in statistical physics, stochastic processes and stochastic thermodynamics, as well as their applications to complex systems coming from biology. 

I am currently a PhD student working with [David Lacoste](https://www.pct.espci.fr/~david/),
in [Gulliver](https://www.gulliver.espci.fr/?-home-&lang=fr) laboratory. 

Besides, I am also very invested in [teaching](/teaching/), and found of [history](/history/)
and philosophy of sciences!
